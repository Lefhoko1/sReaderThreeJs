# Tutor Reading Game App — Vision

## Overview
- Purpose: A mobile-first tutoring and reading-comprehension app where assignments become interactive games to enforce attention, comprehension, and retention.
- Target: Students, Guardians/Parents, Tutors/Lecturers, and Academy owners.
- Platforms: iOS/Android (Expo/React Native). Web is optional for admin/analytics.
- Core Value: Turn reading into an engaging, collaborative experience with schedules, multiplayer sessions, and guardian-driven motivation.

## Goals
- Increase reading comprehension via active interaction (definitions, illustrations, fill-in-the-blanks, rearranging, contextual clues) per paragraph/sentence.
- Encourage consistent study through social visibility, scheduling, and gamification.
- Support offline-first usage with robust sync to the cloud for consistency.
- Respect privacy by allowing students to control visibility (discoverability, schedule visibility).

## Differentiators
- Assignment-as-a-game mechanics with emotional engagement (encourager/mascot, effects, clues).
- Multiplayer, turn-based study sessions with real-time reactions.
- Guardian participation through rewards, encouragement texts, and progress visibility.
- Data-first design with MVVM, entity-driven persistence, and offline-first sync.
 - Built-in points and achievements system to reinforce progress and habits.

## Success Metrics
- Weekly active students and completed assignments.
- Average time-on-reading and comprehension scores.
- Schedule adherence rate and multiplayer participation.
- Guardian engagement (rewards given, messages posted).
